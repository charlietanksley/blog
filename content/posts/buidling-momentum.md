Backstory: I loved blogging back in my graduate school days, but only
around topics that weren't core to my work or identity. I'd blog about
LaTeX when my real job was metaphysics research. I wanted to blog
about tech pretty much as soon as I started my first job, but I've
been reluctant. Always too busy. Never anything to say.

I'm wondering if I can change that. And I'm hoping to do so by writing
a bunch of short, low-pressure posts aggregated in this one big
post. Maybe if all this stuff is framed as an experiment I'll
overthink it less!

I'm changing jobs soon. Next Friday is my last day at my current job
and I start at a new place the following Monday. So this feels like
that time between Christmas and New Year's. Time for reflection. New
Year, New Me. That kind of thing.

In addition to taking stock, I'm doing a bit of reading. In _The
Unicorn Project_, a thing that has stuck out to me is the idea of a
developer journal or diary. I've seen the idea in a bunch of
places. (I want to say _The Pragmatic Programmer_ talks about keeping
a journal for tracking bugs, and I've read about the Lab Notebook idea
in at least a dozen places. And it seems like a good idea to me. But
it's never stuck.

I do write a bunch. I fill up a full-size 100-sheet spiral notebook
every three months or so. But I struggle to keep any continuity in
what I'm recording, and it's very rarely reflective. I use it for in
the moment notes in meetings or solving problems, and while I might
return to them, I never take a step back and sum things up or put
things in a format that might be useful going forward.

But when I've done something like this, I've found it's typically
pretty useful. It's hard to stick to or make a system of.  Part of the
problem there might be that I am trying to systematize it up front. So
maybe this time I'll try a different tack: set frequent check-ins
during the day and see what evolves out of that. Maybe that will give
me a little feedback loop so I can let something evolve.
