It has been ages since I had a blog. Back when I was a graduate
student I felt like I had something to help teach the (academic
humanities) world about LaTeX, so I wrote a blog on the topic and an
educational guide. It was fun and some people seemed to find it useful.

I've been meaning to write about programming ever since I started my
first programming job in 2012. Given my background in the humanities
(and not computer science), I think it felt like something I had to do
to prove my worth as a programmer. So I felt pressure, and as a result
really did anything with it. The few blog posts I wrote for my
company's blog weren't deeply technical; instead they were about the
culture of my company and why I was happy working there. While I liked
the posts, I think that since they weren't about technical topics they
furthered my internal narrative (and fear) that I didn't really have
anything to write about. So I kept not writing, feeling bad about not
writing, and worrying that I wouldn't ever have anything to write
about.

I like writing. It helps me solidify what I'm learning and shape what
I think. And sometimes (as I saw with that LaTeX blog), the finished
product is useful for others as well. And while I like technical
topics just fine, the kinds of blog posts and books I enjoy the most
are the ones that step away from the deep technical details and
instead focus on bigger picture issues like how to think about
problems, how to improve your skills/career, and how to better work
with others. No big surprise there I suppose: the kinds of things I
was interested in writing years ago are the things I'm interested in
reading now.

So I'm going to write more. And publish it here. I'm very uncertain
what that will look like for me - what my process will look like, how
often I'll post, exactly what I'll write about, how long I'll keep it
going, etc. But I'll figure all that out. I do know that while there
might be some technical stuff, my main interest isn't deeply technical
and I have no intention of trying to make my blog deeply technical.

In my free time right now I'm interested in fermentation - yogurt,
sourdough, kombucha, etc. I like the experimental nature of
fermentation. You have an idea of some basic processes and within
those bounds you can try things and just see what happens. Wait
patiently, watch, and see what happens. Maybe it's garbage. Maybe it's
great. That part doesn't really matter to me. Regardless, if you watch
and wait you'll learn something. And that's how I'm approaching this
blog: watching, waiting, letting things develop, and - regardless of
the outcome - learning.
