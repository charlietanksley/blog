<p>Backstory: I loved blogging back in my graduate school days, but only
around topics that weren&rsquo;t core to my work or identity. I&rsquo;d blog about
LaTeX when my real job was metaphysics research. I wanted to blog
about tech pretty much as soon as I started my first job, but I&rsquo;ve
been reluctant. Always too busy. Never anything to say.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if I can change that. And I&rsquo;m hoping to do so by writing
a bunch of short, low-pressure posts aggregated in this one big
post. Maybe if all this stuff is framed as an experiment I&rsquo;ll
overthink it less!</p>

<h2 id="2020-10-16">2020-10-16</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m changing jobs soon. Next Friday is my last day at my current job
and I start at a new place the following Monday. So this feels like
that time between Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s. Time for reflection. New
Year, New Me. That kind of thing.</p>

<p>In addition to taking stock, I&rsquo;m doing a bit of reading. In <em>The
Unicorn Project</em>, a thing that has stuck out to me is the idea of a
developer journal or diary. I&rsquo;ve seen the idea in a bunch of
places. (I want to say <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> talks about keeping
a journal for tracking bugs, and I&rsquo;ve read about the Lab Notebook idea
in at least a dozen places. And it seems like a good idea to me. But
it&rsquo;s never stuck.</p>

<p>I do write a bunch. I fill up a full-size 100-sheet spiral notebook
every three months or so. But I struggle to keep any continuity in
what I&rsquo;m recording, and it&rsquo;s very rarely reflective. I use it for in
the moment notes in meetings or solving problems, and while I might
return to them, I never take a step back and sum things up or put
things in a format that might be useful going forward.</p>

<p>But when I&rsquo;ve done something like this, I&rsquo;ve found it&rsquo;s typically
pretty useful. It&rsquo;s hard to stick to or make a system of.  Part of the
problem there might be that I am trying to systematize it up front. So
maybe this time I&rsquo;ll try a different tack: set frequent check-ins
during the day and see what evolves out of that. Maybe that will give
me a little feedback loop so I can let something evolve.</p>
